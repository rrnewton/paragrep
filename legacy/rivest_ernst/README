% README file for "help" program.
% 
% The "help" program essentially performs a paragraph-wise grep/search,
% though with a number of additional features such as file inclusion.  Given
% a series of words, "help" prints all the paragraphs that match all the
% words.  One use for this is to locate matching records in a plaintext file,
% such as an address list.  Another use is to find short notes you have
% written to yourself that explain various important pieces of information.
% For instance, you might issue commands such as
%   help copier code
%   help latex page break
% and these would return whatever information you had previously placed in
% the files that the help program searches.  To find out more about this
% program, run
%   help help program
% 
% Installation:
%  1. Compile the help program.  (Optionally adjust the #define directives at
%     the top of the file before compiling.)
%  2. Copy this file to your home directory (referred to by your HOME
%     environment variable).  Add additional information to this file, or
%     place that information in other files and edit the \include
%     directives at the end of this file.
%  3. Optionally, define aliases that use the program in stylized ways.  For
%     instance, I define "bibfind" as an alias for
%       help .n .F ~/bib/bibroot
%     which searches my bibliographies.  (The "bibroot" file contains \include
%     directives for all my bibliography files.)
% 
% The help program was originally written by Ron Rivest.  It could probably
% be recoded in several dozen lines of perl (but it already exists, so it's
% easier to use it as it stands).

General help:
To obtain more help, type "help w1 w2 ..." where w1 w2 ... are keywords.
    This will type out all paragraphs in the HELP files that
    contain ALL of the words w1, w2, ... 
    (type "help help program" for more information about "help")

Information about the help program:
 -- You invoke help by typing "help w1 w2 ..." where w1, w2, etc. are
    keywords (or fragments of keywords) that you wish to search for.
 -- The help program searches a number of "help files" that contain
    paragraphs of helpful information.
 -- Every paragraph that contains ALL of the desired keywords will be
    printed.
 -- The "root" help file is ($HOME)/HELP:
      By creating ($HOME)/HELP you can create your own personal "help file"
	      with reminders for yourself.  (You may also use a
	      different file by using the .f flag, described below.)
 -- Any help file can contain a line of the form "\include{filename}"
      which causes help file "filename" to be searched as well.
 -- Any line in a help file which begins with a % will be ignored.
 -- Any help request which does not generate any output (except "Sorry")
      will be appended to /a/aviary/HELP.NEEDED together with your
      name.  Maybe one of the wizards will answer your query and update
      the help file.  (By default, this is disabled in the DOS version.)
 -- There are several optional flags, preceded by . (NOT - as is usual)
      .m  enables more processing.
      .n  causes the name of the file in which a paragraph was found to
	      be printed before the paragraph itself.
      .f filename  makes filename, instead of ~/HELP, the auxiliary help file.
      .w  disables writing failed requests to /a/aviary/HELP.NEEDED.
      .F filename  is like .w .f filename, but doesn't check /a/aviary/HELP.
